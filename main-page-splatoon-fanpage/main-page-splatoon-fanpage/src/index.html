    <p class="PlotSploon1"> Plot </p>
   <div class="Splatoon1Plot"> <p> From the end of humanity to a war between two marine species for territory, Splatoon as a lot to unpack. A long time ago when climate change was at it's peak and hummanity had wars for territory, they tested on maarine creatures for a hope of a new future. years later Inklings and Octolings rise from the water and evolve into humanoids. </p>
    
    
 <p> They lived together untill sea levels rose and soon the Great Truf War happens, a great war between both sea creatures for territory. To summarize the inklings won and the octarians went underground to make an underground civilization. Years later now turf wars are a sport played by inklings for fun, the inkling culture is one out of fashion, sports, music, and over all freshness. THe inklings also have a power source for their cities, The Great Zapfish, an eletric catfish that's large enough to wrap around a whole tower. Inkopolis The Great Zapfish goes missing and one inkling has to save it with the help of Capn'Cuttlfish, the captain of the Squidbeak Splatoon. This inkling is known by fans and through out the story as Agent 3, the first of man agents. During the long quest of trying to save The Great Zapfish from the octarians, whom stole it, you meet Agent 1 and 2, agents of the Squidbeak Splatoon and later on The New Squidbeak Splatoon. Capn'Cuttlefish is kiddnapped (in this case SQUIDnapped) by Dj Octavio, his rival. After reaching the final you battle Dj Octavio, when things seems to be in a check the heavenly melody of the inklings play, Calamari Inkantation, a song by the Squid Sisters that can litteraly change lives. After saving the Great Zapfish, the real story of Splatoon unfolds in the games that come after making an amazing trilogy with more to come. With these games comes the 2 years of platfest, an event where the idols of each game have teams based on themes that people vote and battle for. For example: Dogs VS Cats. Splatfest has ended for Splatoon and Splatoon 2, but currently Splatoon 3 will have splatfests untill 2024. </p>

      <p class="offline"> Splatoon has 2 types of game modes, <bold> online</bold> and <bold> offline </bold> but the game mostly revolves around online modes. To start, the offline modes consist of the story mode and a small minigame called Squid-Jump.</p>
      <p class= "online"> Online modes have a variety of modes compared to offline modes. Starting with turf wars the main rules of it is a 4v4 game where you join up with a team of friends or random people online, this will be how every online mode works, andd the main premise is to ink the ground with your color of ink and at the end the judge, Judd the cat, determines what color is mostly on the ground. Then we have ranked matches, 3 seperate game modes that by winning increases your rank. There is Rainmaker, a game where you have to take the Rainmaker to the other team's turf and dunk it on the stadium, like Basketball. Tower Controll is a mode where you take controll of a moving tower and have to ride it all the way to the enemy's base. Finally we have Splat Zones, where you have to ink a certain zone for how ever long is and who ever had it's color longest wins. </p>
